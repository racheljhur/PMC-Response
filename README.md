This Repo contains helper functions and input files for modeling inelastic behavior of PMC microstructures.
I am currently working on a simple smeared cracking model (from MOOSE) with 2D transverse cross sections of fiber-reinforced composites.

Please contact me at jhur64@gatech.edu if there are any issues running these scripts.
